At the same time, by operating at an efficiency of up to 3.1 micromoles per joule, these lights consume significantly less energy than HPS, or even fluorescent, grow lights. This allows your horticulture operation to get the best yield and quality while keeping operating costs down.<\/p><p>With the dimming capability and the lights' ratchet hanging system, you also gain control over the transition from veg to flower. With this, you'll maximize both crop production and available space by reducing stretch. And with the lower infrared radiation thanks to cooler-running LED technology, you'll experience less evaporation, which means you'll save on water and nutrients. And if you're producing extracts from your crop, you'll see a yield increase there as well.<\/p><p>Shop our selection of X-Series commercial grow lights today & reap the benefits in your bottom line.<\/p><p><em>* We recommend starting them off dimmed and raised as high above the plants as possible, then brightening and adjusting as needed<\/em><\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"","background_type":"full_width","text_width":"fill","text_position":"center","text_alignment":"left","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"164685081114dcfd9a":{"type":"multi-column","blocks":{"1646850811175c659a-0":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4ft_magnetic_strip_2_1.jpg","image_width":100,"image_border":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","title":"How to Install a Fluorescent to LED Strip Retrofit Kit","content":"<p>Watch how quick and easy it is to convert your fluorescent troffers to LED when you use Magnetic Linear LED Retrofit Kits.<\/p>","link_text":"Read more","link_url":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/articles\/how-to-install-a-fluorescent-to-led-conversion-kit","link_style":"link","text_alignment":"center"}},"1646850811175c659a-1":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/drop_celing_blog_thumbnail-2.jpg","image_width":100,"image_border":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","title":"Give Your Drop Ceilings a Lighting Makeover","content":"<p>With LED replacements, you can now get brighter light at higher CRI even from your existing drop ceiling light fixtures.<\/p>","link_text":"Read More","link_url":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/articles\/give-your-drop-ceilings-a-lighting-makeover","link_style":"link","text_alignment":"center"}},"1646850811175c659a-2":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/pick-and-place-machine-310x310w.jpg","image_width":100,"image_border":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","title":"Buy American Act Compliant Lights Aren’t Just for Government Projects","content":"<p>While we’ll be adding even more amazing lights to our Buy American line, the LED Retrofits for Fluorescent Fixtures we have up now show the level of thought and problem-solving that goes into the design of this line of lights.<\/p>","link_text":"Read More","link_url":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/articles\/converting-your-high-bay-fluorescents-to-led-just-got-stupid-easy","link_style":"link","text_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["1646850811175c659a-0","1646850811175c659a-1","1646850811175c659a-2"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"reveal_on_scroll":true,"stack_items":false,"subheading":"","title":"Learn More About Upgrading with LED Strips","content":"","column_alignment":"center","mobile_item_size":"large","desktop_item_size":"large","spacing":"loose","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"1645730287182e7b57":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","settings":{"subheading":"Don't Forget These","title":"Recently Viewed","products_count":6,"background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","16464271594479c537","16464304598ac874d9","1646430706b75bb4fc","164642735062be912f","main","164643107088112c02","164737234766cd9e55","1646854207d554d679","164685081114dcfd9a","1645730287182e7b57"]}
