Our T8 sized tube LED lights are compatible with both T8 and T12 fixtures, allowing you to convert fluorescent to LED with ease.<\/p>\n<h3>Do your LED tubes come with installation instructions?<\/h3>\n<p>ELEDLights makes replacing fluorescent lights with LED lights easy! You can download and preview installation instructions for our LED tube bulbs from the Support Documents tab on any LED tube light's product page.<\/p>\n<h3>How difficult is installation?<\/h3>\n<p>Converting fluorescent to LED is easy, no matter which style of LED fluorescent tube light you choose:<\/p>\n<p>With ballast-bypass LED tubes, you simply reroute the fixture’s wiring to go directly to the lampholders instead of the ballast. This takes about five minutes per fixture. Double-ended-power ballast-bypass tubes use the lampholders already installed in your fixture, further cutting down installation time. Single-ended-power will require replacing your existing lampholders with non-shunted ones (available in the accessories section of our single-ended-power tube product pages).<\/p>\n<p>Ballast-compatible LED tubes require no wiring, but they’re not compatible with every ballast, and the ballast will still consume power, which cuts into your energy savings. The few minutes spent on re-wiring for ballast-bypass tubes is often worth it in the long run.<\/p>\n<h3>What difference do lumens make?<\/h3>\n<p>The lumens of an LED tube bulb indicate its brightness: a 2200 lumen tube is 22% brighter than an 1800 lumen tube, for instance, and a 3000 lumen tube is 66% brighter.<\/p>\n<p><em>Tip:<\/em> LED tube bulbs can provide the same amount of illumination as a fluorescent tube bulb, even when that fluorescent bulb has a higher lumen rating. This is because fluorescent tubes put out 360° of light, sending a good amount of their light upward into the fixture, where it’s essentially lost. Most of our LED fluorescent tube lights are designed to output light out from the fixture, not up into it. The exception is our 360° tubes, which are primarily designed for double-sided sign lighting.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I compare efficiency?<\/h3>\n<p>Lumens\/Watt (lm\/W) is a great way to evaluate efficiency across LED tubes. The higher the number, the more efficient the light is. To give you an idea, a typical 4ft fluorescent tube is rated at 58 lumens\/Watt. Our 4ft LED tubes range from 105 lumens\/Watt to 150 lumens\/Watt. As you can see, even our least efficient LED tube is nearly twice as energy efficient as a standard fluorescent tube! You can find this number in the Specifications section of every product page.<\/p>\n<\/div>","background_type":"boxed","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"1646684661837da5ad":{"type":"custom-html","settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","html":"<hr>","background_type":"full_width","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"164692124599d6abd1":{"type":"promotion-blocks","blocks":{"1646921245b3b60963-0":{"type":"image","settings":{"highlight":false,"subheading":"Save with Rebates","title":"Is your organization's lighting upgrade eligible for money back?","link_text":"Learn More","link_url":"shopify:\/\/pages\/rebates","link_style":"link","text_position":"middle_center","background":"#deeefe","text_color":"#2e2e2e","button_background":"#ffffff","button_text_color":"#1e316a"}},"1646921245b3b60963-2":{"type":"image","settings":{"highlight":false,"subheading":"Attention Contractors","title":"Join our free lighting partner program for discounts & priority service.","link_text":"Learn more","link_url":"shopify:\/\/pages\/contractors-electricians-installers","link_style":"link","text_position":"middle_center","background":"#deeefe","text_color":"#2e2e2e","button_background":"#ffffff","button_text_color":"#1e316a"}},"b7c8aa21-3676-43a3-9e14-fc0fa3d3b00c":{"type":"image","settings":{"highlight":false,"subheading":"Need Lighting Help?","title":"Our in-house pros do lighting layouts, energy audits, and much more.","link_text":"Learn More","link_url":"shopify:\/\/pages\/lighting-services-request","link_style":"link","text_position":"middle_center","background":"#deeefe","text_color":"#2e2e2e","button_background":"#ffffff","button_text_color":"#1e316a"}}},"block_order":["1646921245b3b60963-0","1646921245b3b60963-2","b7c8aa21-3676-43a3-9e14-fc0fa3d3b00c"],"settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","section_size":"medium","stack_on_mobile":true,"background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"1645730287182e7b57":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"subheading":"","title":"Your Recents","products_count":6,"background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","16466830950ea93fea","164668310026eee994","16457287990a80b0c3","1646683189330ed8ef","16466832755fbba15e","main","1660162454fcd8acf9","65888d7f-c88c-4be2-bfab-bc3a0c8f1e56","4a578a68-f94e-4e8a-b9c3-6552d8dd859a","16469361959cc5beef","16469361888d6cd1cc","fdd306cd-a13a-4837-bb62-0e9510280e81","d516e3c7-2b20-4a63-a99f-55c3109dfc41","164668487500e200eb","16611899573a4635e3","1646684661837da5ad","164692124599d6abd1","1645730287182e7b57"]}
