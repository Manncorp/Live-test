At the same time, by operating at an efficiency of up to 3.1 micromoles per joule, these lights consume significantly less energy than HPS, or even fluorescent, grow lights. This allows your horticulture operation to get the best yield and quality while keeping operating costs down.<\/p><p>With the dimming capability and the lights' ratchet hanging system, you also gain control over the transition from veg to flower. With this, you'll maximize both crop production and available space by reducing stretch. And with the lower infrared radiation thanks to cooler-running LED technology, you'll experience less evaporation, which means you'll save on water and nutrients. And if you're producing extracts from your crop, you'll see a yield increase there as well.<\/p><p>Shop our selection of X-Series commercial grow lights today & reap the benefits in your bottom line.<\/p><p><em>* We recommend starting them off dimmed and raised as high above the plants as possible, then brightening and adjusting as needed<\/em><\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"","background_type":"full_width","text_width":"fill","text_position":"center","text_alignment":"left","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"164737234766cd9e55":{"type":"image-with-text-overlay","disabled":true,"settings":{"reveal_on_scroll":true,"loading":"lazy","section_height":"auto","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/grow-light-application-1240x357.jpg","subheading":"","title":"","content":"","button_text":"","button_link":"","link_style":"link","background_type":"full_width","text_width":"medium","text_position":"middle_center","text_color":"#ffffff","button_background":"#ffffff","button_text_color":"#000000","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":30}},"1645730287182e7b57":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"subheading":"Don't Forget These","title":"Recently Viewed","products_count":6,"background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","16464271594479c537","16464304598ac874d9","164642735062be912f","main","164643107088112c02","1646854207d554d679","164737234766cd9e55","1645730287182e7b57"]}
