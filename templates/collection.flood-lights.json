As a general guideline: For highlighting details and signage, 5,000-10,000 lumens is often good, small to medium outdoor spaces will need 20,000-30,000 lumens, and large commercial and industrial settings may require 50,000 lumens or higher for adequate illumination. For a free layout of the best lighting for your outdoor space, reach out to our team!<\/p>\n<h4>What is the difference between a flood light and a high mast light?<\/h4>\n<p>High mast lights are designed to illuminate bigger outdoor areas, such as stadiums, highway interchanges, very large parking lots, airports, seaports, and large industrial areas. These are powerful lights mounted on very high (over 40 feet) poles. LED high mast lights save a significant amount of money in energy costs compared to traditional high mast lighting technology, such as high-pressure sodium, mercury vapor, and metal halide, due to the enormous amount of power these older lights had to draw to provide the required amount of light<\/p>\n<p>Flood lights are less intense and used for a wider variety of applications, from architectural and landscape lighting to area lighting for small parking lots and playgrounds, to security lighting around building and fence perimeters. <\/p>\n<h4>Can I replace flood lights with LED?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, you can replace traditional flood lights with LED flood lights. LED technology offers numerous advantages, including energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and reduced maintenance, making it a cost-effective and eco-friendly choice.<\/p>\n<h4>Are LED flood lights worth it?<\/h4>\n<p>Absolutely! LED flood lights are worth the investment due to their energy efficiency, extended lifespan, and reduced maintenance costs. They provide high-quality lighting and contribute to long-term savings on energy bills – often saving customers 50% or more on overhead.<\/p>\n<\/div>","background_type":"full_width","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"ceed1f0a-028d-4a32-8b7b-ba7b9518f257":{"type":"custom-html","settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","html":"<div style=\"max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; background: #f5f5f5; padding: 40px;\">\n<h2 class=\"heading h2\">High Quality Commercial LED Flood Lights for Safety, Security and Ambiance<\/h2>\n<p>Light up your property at night with durable, affordable LED flood light fixtures from ELEDLights.
