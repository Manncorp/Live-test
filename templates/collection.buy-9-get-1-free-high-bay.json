For low bay lights, this includes machine and auto shops, garages, small warehouses and manufacturing areas, small hangars, retail stores, fitness centers, and more. For high bays, it means facilities such as medium to large warehouses, factories, processing plants, larger hangars, gymnasiums, arenas, and more.<\/p><p><strong>High Bay vs Low Bay—Which Do I Need?<\/strong><\/p><p>The answer is as simple as ceiling height. High bay lights are typically installed in ceilings over 20 feet. They’re higher wattage, in order to output more lumens (light), and the higher they’re installed, the narrower the beam angle you’ll want to choose, in order to compensate for the vertical distance between the fixture and the work area.<\/p><p>Low bay lights are designed for installations where the ceilings are between 12 feet and 20 feet. Their wider beam angle spreads the light over a larger area in a shorter vertical distance.<\/p><p>If you have questions about what wattage, style, or beam angle to get for your application, ask our lighting experts! We’ve been assisting customers with high bay and low bay LED lights for all sorts of applications since 2012.<\/p><p><strong>Why Choose LED for High and Low Bay Lighting?<\/strong><\/p><p>Metal halide high bay lights are an enormous draw on power. High-output fluorescents (such as T5HO) were supposed to be the energy-friendly solution to metal halide’s power draw, but their performance turned out to be less than overwhelming. LED high bays, however, produce brilliant light at a fraction of the energy cost. They also last significantly longer than the older technologies. And, because we know that installing a factory or gymnasium’s worth of high bay lights is an undertaking,<\/p><p>ELEDLights provides only high quality LED high bay and low bay fixtures and retrofit lamps. We want your lighting install to go smoothly and for you to be satisfied with your lighting purchase, not just the first day you turn the lights on, but for many years to come.<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"","background_type":"full_width","text_width":"fill","text_position":"center","text_alignment":"left","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","button_text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"1645730287182e7b57":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","settings":{"subheading":"","title":"Recently Viewed","products_count":6,"background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","1646430706b75bb4fc","main","164642735062be912f","164643107088112c02","16464310675447796a","1645730287182e7b57"]}
