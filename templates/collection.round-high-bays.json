Here's why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>High Lumen Output<\/strong>: UFO LED high bay lights are designed to emit a high intensity of light, making them ideal for applications with high ceilings.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Energy Efficiency<\/strong>: LED technology allows for significant energy savings compared to traditional HID or fluorescent high bay lights. Given the high power consumption of HID technology in particular, LED UFO high bay lights can provide robust illumination at a mere fraction of the energy cost.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Durability<\/strong>: Most round LED high bay lights are built with a robust design, making them suitable for challenging environments, such as industrial facilities &amp; indoor athletic courts.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Heat Dissipation<\/strong>: Good UFO LED high bay lights are designed with effective heat dissipation systems, which contributes to a longer lifespan and increased energy efficiency.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Versatility<\/strong>: These lights are easy to mount, usually include dimming capability, and often offer motion sensor accessories. Many high bay UFO lights are now power and\/or color selectable as well, for in-the-field customization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Where UFO LED High Bay Lights Are Used:<\/h3>\n<p>UFO LED high bay lights are typically used in large indoor spaces with high ceilings, where strong, even light is required. These include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Warehouses and Distribution Centers<\/strong>: These spaces require bright, consistent lighting for both safety and productivity. The durability and energy efficiency of UFO LED high bay lights make them an excellent choice, even for aisle and racking lighting.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Factories and Industrial Buildings<\/strong>: Industrial settings need strong lighting for safety and precision in work. LED UFO high bay lights provide good visibility, reduce eye strain, and enhance safety in such environments.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Gyms and Sports Arenas<\/strong>: Indoor sports facilities, like basketball courts or swimming pools, need bright, consistent lighting that doesn't produce a lot of heat. The design of the UFO LED high bay light is perfect for these requirements, and a number of them now come with IK08 or IK10 ratings, for extra protection against impact from sports balls.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Retail Stores and Supermarkets<\/strong>: Large retail spaces and supermarkets require bright lighting to display goods effectively. UFO LED high bay lights provide high-quality light, enhancing the visual appeal of products. Today's UFO high bays are more compact and attractive than HID high bays of the past, making them well suited for modern stores.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Convention Centers and Exhibition Halls<\/strong>: The high ceilings and large floor areas of these spaces can be effectively lit using UFO LED high bay lights, providing clear, bright light for events and exhibitions.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workshops and Garages<\/strong>: In spaces where detailed tasks are carried out, like vehicle repair bays, strong lighting is crucial. High bay LED UFO lights not only provide good visibility but are resistant to dust and moisture, making them suitable for  environments where bay doors are often open or water may be sprayed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>UFO LED high bay lights are not only versatile and durable, but their long lifespan and reduced maintenance requirements make them an excellent choice for a variety of large, indoor spaces where bright, consistent lighting is hard to reach and absolutely necessary to the use of the space.<\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a Model<\/h3>\n<p>When choosing a UFO high bay LED light for your application, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Lumen Output and Efficiency<\/strong>: Consider the brightness (lumens) you need and the luminous efficacy (lumens per watt) of the fixture. The higher the luminous efficacy, the lower the wattage you'll need to reach your target illumination levels, and the lower the wattage, the lower your light bill.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Color Temperature<\/strong>: Choose a color temperature (measured in Kelvins) suitable for your application. For instance, a neutral white (4000K) might be suitable for a retail setting, while a cooler white (5000K) may be better for a warehouse.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lifespan and Warranty<\/strong>: Look at the expected lifespan of the light and the warranty offered by the manufacturer. Consider the lighting supplier's capability to support the warranty as wellâare they easy to get in touch with? Will they be around if you need warranty support down the road?<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dimmability and Controls<\/strong>: If you need flexibility in light levels, look for models with dimming capabilities or compatibility with lighting control systems.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Certifications<\/strong>: For certain environments, you might need lights with specific certifications (like DLC for rebates, or UL\/ETL for safety standards). ELEDLights offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eledlights.com\/collections\/high-bay-washdown-lights\" title=\"https:\/\/www.eledlights.com\/collections\/high-bay-washdown-lights\">NSF-certified LED high bays<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eledlights.com\/collections\/hazloc-high-bay-lights\" title=\"https:\/\/www.eledlights.com\/collections\/hazloc-high-bay-lights\">HazLoc\/explosion proof rated LED high bays<\/a> as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, choosing the right LED UFO high bay light depends on the specifics of your space and requirements.
