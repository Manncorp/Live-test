Poorly lit parking lots, campuses, car dealerships, hospitals, alleys, roadways, and apartment grounds create opportunities for crime, trip-and-fall injuries, and other safety and security issues. They also don’t beckon customers to your location.<\/p>\n    <p>Outdoor area lighting, however, has the problem of being installed 20 to 40 feet off the ground. Traditionally, this makes replacing failed lamps a frequent and costly maintenance task. With LED pole lights, you can significantly reduce the number of lamp replacements, thanks to the technology's extended life. At the same time, you'll significantly reduce your associated maintenance costs.<\/p>\n    <p>That’s why our customers choose LED lighting when they upgrade or install new lighting for parking lots, alleys, roads, loading docks, outdoor storage areas, campuses, plazas, outdoor venues, farm properties, and many other locations.<\/p>\n    <\/div>","background_type":"full_width","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","16464271594479c537","1646430756f21771b2","main","16464304598ac874d9","custom_html_MmHXTh","1646430706b75bb4fc","164643107088112c02","featured_collections_BGQ7dd","249030e9-0e33-462f-9ea2-d6e9d24357cd","1647283182de8a7a05","16472833500486958c","1645730287182e7b57","b3a3ad60-f75b-4373-ae15-e5f876be5b66"]}
