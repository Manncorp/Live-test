If the fixture is both color and wattage selectable, there will be two sets of dip switches.<br><br><strong>Q: Why choose a Field-Selectable light over a standard one?<\/strong><br>A: You have increased flexibility with Field-Selectable lighting. By buying one light type, you can outfit a variety of spaces. You can set welcoming spaces like waiting areas or breakrooms with less intense, warm light while spaces dedicated to concentration can be cooler and more brightly lit. Plus, since you get to choose your energy usage, you have the opportunity to further reduce utility costs. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is installation more complex?<br>A: <\/strong>Absolutely not! Field-selectable fixtures are installed just like fixed color &amp; wattage fixtures. There are no extra wires nor extra wiring involved. The only difference is that you have dip switches located on the fixture to allow for wattage and\/or color temperature selection.<\/p>\n<\/div>","background_type":"boxed","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"2130ac50-8630-4217-807c-1d443c2b462b":{"type":"custom-html","disabled":true,"settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","html":"<div style=\"padding: 0 40px\">\n<h3 class=\"heading h2\" style=\"margin: 0\">The Flexible Lighting Option<\/h3>\n<p><strong>For End Users:<\/strong> Reduce the risk of buying lights you're not happy with.
