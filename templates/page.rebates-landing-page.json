ELEDLights regularly processes rebates for our customers. In fact, last year we helped customers in just one utility program save nearly $400k altogether in their lighting upgrade costs.

Take lighting: running old, inefficient lighting is not only costing you twice as much as newer lights, it also comes with frequent re-lamping costs, and it tends toward faster degradation of light output than newer lighting technology. But of course it costs money to replace your old lighting.<\/p>\n<p>That's where energy efficiency rebates and incentives come in. In order to incentivize companies to move toward more efficient technology, many utilities have set up incentive programs that cover some of the cost of the upgrade. Sometimes these incentives can be significant, taking the cost of new lights down to not much more than $1 per fixture. Sometimes it's more like $40 per fixture, which is still a decent price to pay for new $200 luminaires. How much is available to you  depends in part on the program available where you're at and in part on what lighting decisions you make. We can help you with both.<\/p>\n<p>And it's not just end users that can benefit from incentives. Incentives make it possible for property developers to include advanced lighting upgrades as part of building renovations; the cost to provide that increase in value can be offset by the incentives available for installing the upgrades.<\/p>\n<p>Updating to energy efficient lighting allows you to cut energy overhead while enjoying reduced maintenance costs for the life of the lighting. It's a great long-term investment.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px\">Energy efficiency incentives make doing that upgrade financially smart—even in the short term<\/h3>\n<p>When you take advantage of all the energy efficiency incentives available to you, you can save on not only the cost of your new lights but also on occupancy &amp; daylight sensors and advanced lighting controls that bring you even more energy savings. You may even be eligible to save on installation costs and the permanent removal of old fixtures as well!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Whether you could use new lights in a single office or across an entire industrial complex, or if you're a contractor with commercial clients you'll be speccing or installing new lights for, ELEDLights can help you access all of the energy incentives available to lighting project.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px\">Cut your energy bill by taking advantage of lighting incentives<\/h3>\n<p>ELEDLights has helped companies like yours offset the costs of new lighting with energy efficiency incentives, at no additional cost. If your lighting upgrade qualifies for rebates, we can help make submitting your applications—and getting your incentive—fast and\neasy. Depending on the utility, we may be able to process your rebate instantly as part of your lighting order!
