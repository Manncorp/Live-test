The difference between the two—panels and troffers—is mainly in appearance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Panel lights sit flush <\/strong>in your suspended ceiling grid and are flat all the way across, like a ceiling tile that happens to light up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Troffers appear as recessed <\/strong>lights and use a volumetric design that’s geared toward making your room appear brighter.<\/p>\n<p>Either way you decide, you can rely on excellent color rendering, long operating life, and easy installation. <\/p>\n<p>Have questions?
