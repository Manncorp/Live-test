This includes switching from older, less efficient LED lighting to today's state of the art technology.<\/p> \n\n<h3>Why are utilities offering free money to switch?<\/h3> <p>Between electric cars, bitcoin mining, the growth of electronic devices in homes and businesses, and increasing automation in manufacturing and other industries, the power grid is taking on ever-heavier loads.<\/p> \n\n<p>Incentives, like those offered through PECO Ways to Save, are an economical way for utilities to reduce the load on the power grid and keep electricity affordable for everyone.<\/p> \n\n<h3>These incentives are a fantastic deal that every eligible company in the PECO area should take advantage of<\/h3>\n<p><\/p> \n\n<p>But it can be a lot of work to navigate the programs, sort out the requirements, and plan a whole lighting upgrade project. <\/p> \n\n<p>Fortunately, you don't have to!<\/p> \n\n<h3>ELEDLights has been making it easy for companies in the PECO area to take advantage of these financial incentives for years<\/h3> <p>Your company can benefit from our years of expertise in lighting projects and utility incentives.<\/p> \n\n<p>We can present your company with a lighting plan for your upgrade, complete with all the information on incentives you qualify for, how much you'll save in project costs, and how much you'll go on to save in energy costs over the life of your new lights.

Our customers also save on lighting controls, which are also often covered under the PECO Ways to Save program. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Savings aren't just one and done, either<\/h3>\n<p>After installation, your new LED lights will use up to 70% less energy than traditional lights and can last up to 50 times longer. This means your company can save thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars each year on energy bills and maintenance costs. <\/p> \n\n<p>Typical ROI for upgrades funded by energy efficiency incentives are measured in months, not years—that's how great a deal these incentives are for companies.<\/p> \n\n<h3>ELEDLights is a leading provider of LED lighting<\/h3>\n<p>Plus, we have rebate experts on staff with a track record of getting great deals for our local customers.
