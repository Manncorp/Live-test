The efficiency of LED technology allows for smaller back-up batteries without sacrificing emergency operation time. Smaller batteries mean lighter weight and lower-profile fixtures. <\/p>\n<h3 class=\"heading h3\">Emergency Backup Drivers<\/h3>\n<p>LED battery backup drivers are after-market add-ons that allow ordinary LED fixtures to operate as emergency lighting during power outages. Backup drivers are often installed in LED high bay lights, panel lights, and troffer lights.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"heading h3\">LED Lights with Built-In Emergency Lighting<\/h3>\n<p>These LED lights function as normal lighting until a power outage occurs, at which point they switch over to emergency lighting. Because the emergency battery, driver, and test button are integrated into the fixture, the only thing you need to do is install the lights in your location.<\/p>\n<\/div>","background_type":"full_width","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"1645730287182e7b57":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"subheading":"","title":"Recently Viewed","products_count":6,"background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["collection-banner","16464271594479c537","16464304598ac874d9","main","164643107088112c02","164642735062be912f","79e4bcf5-ba82-42d6-8d8b-928c3e917752","1645730287182e7b57"]}
