Take lighting, for example: older, inefficient lighting is not only costing you twice as much as newer lights, it also comes with frequent re-lamping costs. And even older LED upgrades aren't keeping up with the energy savings you can get from the latest in ultra-high-efficiency lighting.<\/p>\n<p>But, of course, it costs money to replace your lights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That's where energy rebates and incentives come in.<\/strong> In order to move companies toward more efficient technology that puts less stress on the power grid, many utilities have set up incentive programs that cover a portion—sometimes a significant portion—of the cost of a lighting upgrade for a commercial property. In some areas, these incentives can take the cost of new lights down to as low as $1 per fixture plus tax. In other areas it may be more like $40 per fixture, which is still an excellent price to pay for new $200 luminaires.<\/p>\n\n<p>How much money is available for your lighting upgrade depends in part on the incentives program available for your location and in part on the lighting decisions you make.<\/p>\n<p> <strong>ELEDLights helps dealerships with both.<\/strong> And we provide that legwork at no additional cost when you source your new lights from us.<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0553\/0605\/9812\/files\/car-dealership-led-parking-lot-lights.jpg?v=1647031151\">\n\n<\/div>","background_type":"boxed","background":"#f5f5f5","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"16545468278e132c10":{"type":"custom-html","settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","html":"<div style=\"max-width: 1200px; margin: 30px auto -80px auto; text-align: center\">\n<h2 class=\"heading h2\" style=\"color: #1372b9;\">What's It Like to Work with ELEDLights?<\/h2>\n<\/div>","background_type":"boxed","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"2a5d5aa3-d924-4a23-80b0-507495490075":{"type":"testimonials-section","blocks":{"cf1db8fc-ffa6-42fa-ad92-2e376d920dee":{"type":"video","settings":{"title":"Team Toyota of Glen Mills","directionSelect":"directionLR","rating":"5","testimonialAuthor":"Joe Krupiak, Team Toyota of Glen Mills","testimonialProject":"Upgraded Service Bay & Body Shop Lighting","testimonialDescription":"Our electricity provider was offering energy credits.
