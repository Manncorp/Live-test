High bays are higher wattage, in order to ensure more light reaches the work area. The higher they’re installed, the narrower the beam angle you’ll want to choose in order to compensate for the vertical distance between fixture and work area.  Low bay lights, conversely, have a wider beam angle that spreads the light out more within a shorter vertical distance (between fixture and work area).If you have questions about what wattage, style, or beam angle to get for your application, ask our lighting experts!
