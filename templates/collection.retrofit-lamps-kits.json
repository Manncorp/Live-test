You'd be surprised how easy it is to replace your fluorescent tubes with LED tubes or LED strips, convert your HO fixtures with swing-into-place panels, or replace metal halide, high pressure sodium, and other HID lamps with screw-in LED retrofits or metal halide retrofit kits.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Our retrofit lights often require only that you bypass your fixture's ballast, if it has one, before installing the replacement lamp or retrofit kit. Bypassing the ballast, which normally takes no more than a few minutes, is in itself an energy savings: ballasts use between 5 and 30 percent of your lamp's wattage. It also eliminates—permanently—the maintenance cost of replacing failing ballasts. <\/p><p><\/p><p>ELEDLights has retrofit lamps and kits available to replace T8 and T12 fluorescent tubes, CFLs, metal halide, high pressure sodium, mercury vapor, and R40 incandescent can lights. If you have questions about which retrofit is best for your needs and what's involved with retrofitting your fixtures, get in touch with our team!<\/p><p><\/p><p>Also, if you've already upgraded to LED, but your upgrade was 5 or more years ago, you can significantly increase your energy savings with today's 140 lm\/W and higher efficiencies. They also run cooler to last longer. Some LED retrofits are even available with controls now, from occupancy sensors to full Bluetooth mesh connectivity.
